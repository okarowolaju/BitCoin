# BitcoinSV: The REAL Bitcon



## Overview and Origin

The story goes that a person or group under the pseudonym, "Satoshi Nakomoto" published the Bitcoin whitepaper that completely revolutionized the way we look at and think of money.[[1]](https://news.bitcoin.com/how-bitcoins-peer-to-peer-cash-system-was-revealed-11-years-ago/#:~:text=On%20the%20eve%20of%20Halloween%20on%20October%2031%2C%202008%2C%20Satoshi,existence%20following%20Bitcoin's%20initial%20launch.)

According to the whitepaper itself, the reason why this project was created was to solve the inherent problem of trust being a required input for financial transactions. Because of the nature of the industry and the flow of money, this trust was always leveraged to to banks and huge financial institutions.[[2]](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)

Even better, the funding of this project would come as a result of its utility and the concept of scarcity. Unlike the current financial system, there is a fixed supply of Bitcoin that will ever exist. This means that its price can not be manipulated as a result of creating or destroying bitcoin and its value is always determined by the market. At what price are people willing to buy and sell Bitcoin. Over time, as scarcity plays a more important role, its value will continue to increase the rate based on this supply and demand factor.


## Business Activities:

Trust is an integral part of human society. It's represented in multiple different factors such as credit score and worthiness, interest rates, terms, contracts and a great deal of other technologies and mechanisms needed to enforce trust. The breakdown of this model is that trust can and often times are over allocated to specific groups and under-allocated to others. It does not provide a system where transactions can be make for transaction sake. In other words, humans need trust but are untrustworthy at enforcing it.

The genesis behind Bitcoin is the computers and machines are inherently more trustworthy than humans and should replace them as the arbiter of trust relative to financial transactions. This attracted an early adopter type of users that appealed to the idea of financial transactions being owned an operated by a group of people and machines who complimented one another. People to provide the exchange of value, machines to enforce trust and security. The target user was the un-banked in societies were trust was extremely unfeasible, and also communities that needed to transact without the huge fees being collected by untrustworthy intermediaries.

Now as Bitcoin evolved, there were differing opinions about the implementation of block-sizes. BitcoinSV - opted for larger block-sizes than their predecessors, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.

This allowed for orders of magnitude more utility and ultimately more technologies being built onto of Bitcoin as a platform and network. One of said technologies is a social-media networking company called [[3]](https://twetch.com), who claims to be giving users back their data by storing all transaction on-chain and compensating users for using the platform.

This kind of utility is what will scale BitcoinSV further than any other network.

The other technology used in creating this website is ReactJs[[4]](https://reactjs.org), MoneyButton [[5]](https://moneybutton.com) and and RelayX [[6]](https://relayx.io). All technologies that are extremely well documented in each of these inks.


## Landscape:

BitconSV is in a multifaceted domain. It can be considered a financial instrunment, a form of payment, a database and offline and online network - but most people know it as a digital asset.

The biggest trends in the digital asset landscape is the the way it has attracted speculators who are betting on the appreciation of thiss asset class.

As I highlighted, what will continue to create value in this space is the utlity of BitcoinSV which will be driven my developers int the space. There has been a particular developer named Unwriter [[7]](https://github.com/unwriter) who has singled handidly built the entire infrastructure for BitcoinSV in a sense of providing APIs, database infrastructure, tutorials and has recenlt saught funding to expand the utility of BitcoinSV.


## Results

The results of this company is too premature to make any decisions but from the progress of their Beta, I would give a very optimistic view of this company. Because it has spent little to no money on marketing, it is still fairly unknown to the general public. With a lot of the scrutiny online social media platforms has been placing, it may bring about an environment conducive to their growth.

Core metrics that are being used are number of transactions on the chain, price and block-size. Block-size is an especially important metrics because it is what sets it apart from other platforms in the Bitcoin sphere. With increased number of larger block transactions, it will affirm the thesis that his change is what will make Bitcoin scaleable and provide utility to the everyday user.

Because the space is fairly new, there has been little no competitors in the space. If there are I haven't been able to uncover them in the web of complexity that is the crypto space. It can be argued that BitcoinSV is competing against every other blockchain in the world, but that wouldn't a great comparison.

However, coingeek did conduct a small comparison between three competing platforms which showed that for the user, Twetch was the most profitable. [[8]](https://coingeek.com/twetch-vs-powping-to-tip-or-to-pay/)

All in all, BitcoinSV will continue its war for mindshare and marketshare in both the Blockchain, finance, transaction, database and legacy network and application space.



## Recommendations

My recommendation is that you join Twetch (here is an [invite)](https://twet.ch/inv/145ffa03) and see for yourself. The space is growing and over the last week we've seen a Bull Run in BSV that has taken the price from a $166 range to $250 with plenty of space to go from the previous All Time High of $420.

After that is price discovery and this may bring even more attention to the applications that leverage BitcoinSV as a utility to power their applications.
